## Exercise 4 - The Unintentional Overwrite

Finally time for you to start coding!

This branch consists of a simple cache implementation. Your task it to break it, expose the weaknesses - and fix it.

 * Make tests that checks the initial logic
 * Make tests that breaks the cache
 * Refactor the cache until your tests are ok
 
This is a TDD approach of testing code. It works exactly as "normal" TDD but we already have an implementation. The code is your first specification.
